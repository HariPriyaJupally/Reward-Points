# Reward-Points

# Problem Statement

- A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

- Interview coding assignment below.

- A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction

- (e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x\$50 = 90 points).

- Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

- Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution

# How to start the application

# Functionality of the application

- Select a user from the drop-down

- You can see reward points for selected 3 months on screen with a small description on down where it says from which month
  (start date) to which month (end date).

- Click the toggle button which says "View all transactions of the selected user", this gives all the transactions made by the user.
